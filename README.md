**Team Project for FootBall_players_Analysis**
The Big Data Analysis for Football Team Formation project aimed to use big data algorithms  to analyse football player performance data and identify the best players for each position.  The project team used this analysis to form the best possible team based on player statistics  and performance metrics.

**Project objective**
• To examine individual performance data for football using big data algorithms.
• To determine the top players for each position based on their performance metrics and 
data.
• To assemble the most effective squad based on the findings of the analysis.
• To assess the success of the team's composition based on performance information.
• To Implement the data science workflow (Ask, Get, Explore, Model, Share)

**Project Purpose**
The Big Data Analysis for Football Team Formation is an exciting initiative that analyses 
player performance data to determine the top players for each position using big data 
algorithms. The main goal of the project is to build the best team feasible using player 
statistics and performance metrics.
The project team will create a model that, using performance measures, can determine who is 
the best player for each position.
Once the model is created, the project team can use it to choose the best candidate for each 
role to create the best team possible. The team can then make data-driven choices during a 
game by using this information to improve their game plan.
The team can create game plans that concentrate on delivering the ball to the striker in the 
final third of the field, for instance, if they are aware that their striker has a high shot 
accuracy rate.
As a result of the analysis, the best team will be created using the player statistics, but it will 
also provide information on how to create the most effective game plans.

**Project Scope**
• The team will involve the football players dataset of 2022 to address our objectives.
• To find the most pertinent metrics to use in the analysis, the project team will explore 
their knowledge in both big data analysis and football.
• The team will use the analysis results to form the best possible team based on player 
statistics and performance metrics.
• The Analysis will help to form the best game plan.
• This will be best model to use it to form the best team and create a game plan before 
the game.
• This will also be useful to analyze the team after the game.

**Project Methodology**
Project team will use descriptive statistics method to examine FIFA 22 statistics and learn more about the distribution and characteristics of the data. Here are the methods for using descriptive statistics on data from FIFA 22.
• Team will extract the data from Kaggle
• Team will clean the data by removing any missing values or outliers that may skew 
the results.
• Team will the features that will help our analysis such as mean, median, mode, 
standard deviation, range, or frequency distribution.
• Team will calculate, interpret, and visualize the key findings.

Project Team will also use the best model to predict the best players for each position with their metrics. Here are the steps to do it. 
• Team will Load the data into the data structures like Pandas data frame or NumPy 
array.
• Team will preprocess the data which involves Data profiling, Data Cleansing, Data 
reduction, Data transformation, Data enrichment and data Validation.
• Team will use descriptive statistics results and correlation technique to select the 
metrics to use in the model for prediction.
• Team will split the data into two parts like training data and testing data for the model to predict the best players out of the selected metrics.
• Team will also evaluate and optimize the model for the prediction of best player for each position.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, by using big data algorithms to assess the performance of 
individual players, our project plan seeks to fundamentally alter the way 
football teams are constructed. The best players in each position will be 
determined by our team of experts using a thorough analysis of the FIFA 22 full 
player dataset using an algorithm. In doing so, we will be able to offer football 
managers and coaches priceless insights that will help them put together the best 
squad possible and improve their chances of winning games.
We are adamant that this initiative has the potential to revolutionize the football 
business and establish higher benchmarks for player analysis.
Make a big influence on the football world by travelling with us on this journey. 
Let's collaborate to bring football players' skills to the fore of the game and 
unlock their untapped potential.
